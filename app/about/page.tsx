          Creator-Owned. Fan-Powered.

          InOrbyt is a next-generation platform redefining how creators, fans, and freelancers connect. We believe creative work should be owned, not rented, and that communities should share in the growth they help build.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#0a0e1a]/80 mb-4" style={{ fontSize: '16px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
          InOrbyt lets creators launch personal tokens that unlock access, perks, and new forms of collaboration. Fans can collect tokens, support the creators they love, and participate more deeply in their journeys. Freelancers can discover projects and gigs within the creator economy, all powered by transparent technology and fair economics.

          We’re building a new orbit for creativity: one where value flows directly between people, not platforms.

          InOrbyt was founded by Pia Simeoni, a creator and strategist who believes artists should own their work and the communities they build. Pia created InOrbyt to bridge the gap between creativity and technology, empowering creators to launch their own micro-economies and collaborate freely without gatekeepers.
